## Project Overview
The Secrets-api-Project application fetches a random secret from the Secrets API and displays it on a web page along with the username of the person whose secret it is. This project helped me gain a basic understanding of how APIs work and how to integrate them into a web application.

## Tech Stack
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page.
- **Node.js**: For setting up the backend server.
- **Express.js**: For managing server-side logic and routing.
- **EJS**: For rendering dynamic content on the web page.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the API.

## Features
- **Random Secret Fetching**: Retrieves random secrets from the API and displays them on the web page.
- **Backend Server**: Uses Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and routing.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes EJS to render dynamic content on the frontend.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API using Axios.
